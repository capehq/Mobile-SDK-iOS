This will ensure  operators use the correct set of geospatial information and flight functions for their  aircraft, as determined by their geographical location and user profile.  A summary  of the activation system is:  - Users in China are required to activate their application  by logging into their DJI account at least once every three months within the application  - Activation will be persistent in the application until the user logs out  - A data  connection will be required to log into a DJI account  - Outside of China, the SDK will  automatically activate the application without requiring the user to log in  - Additionally, users in china are required to bind their aircraft to their user account  in DJI Go. This is required only once.  If an application is not activated, the aircraft  not bound (if required), or a legacy version of the SDK (<4.1) is being used, all camera live  streams will be disabled, and flight will be limited to a cylinder of 100m diameter and 30m height to ensure the aircraft stays within line of sight.
